              When I manage to build something that saves people time and
              prevents them from doing tedious tasks, I know that I am making a
              difference in that person's life. They now have more time to be
              with their kids, more time to think up ideas something computers
              cannot and more time to connect to people.<span id="dotsRecent"

                >My life wasn’t playful and neither was I. Everything was so
                serious. My decisions were made based on how I could achieve
                more and I was unhappy. I kept setting new goals for myself but
                when I achieved the goal, the happiness derived from it quickly
                faded. I longed for contentment but my thirst for more overruled
                time after time. I didn’t understand others who weren’t as
                driven as me but instead were silly and playful. Appreciating
                simplicity and the small things was a challenge because the big
                constantly outweighed the simple.At some point, I took a long
                hard look at myself, the person I was and the person I was
                becoming. I didn't like what I saw. I had become shallow and
                pretentious, convincing myself that I could find contentment in
                what a dollar could buy me rather than finding wealth in living
                a life of authenticity and simple happiness. It was then that I
                started to realize how happy others were who understood and
                appreciated the small things in life. My mother and grandmother
                lived this every day but I never understood it. They had what I
                was missing. They were content. I realized that finding joy and
                appreciation in simple things didn’t mean I was simple-minded.
                Actually, it meant quite the opposite. I began uncovering and

              What is the main use of CSS? CSS is the language for describing
              the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and
              fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types
              of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS
              is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup
